# Jumia-Product-Sales
## Introduct ##
Jumia is one of Africa's leading e-commerce platforms, offering a wide variety of products including electronics, fashion, household items, and more. Operating across several African countries, Jumia connects buyers with sellers and provides services such as logistics and payment solutions.

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into product performance on the Jumia platform. Specifically, the dashboard evaluates how product ratings, discounts, and customer reviews correlate with sales outcomes. By examining these factors, the analysis aims to identify what drives customer engagement and purchasing decisions, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about pricing strategies, product promotion, and customer experience optimization.

### Tool Used:
Excel.

## Data Cleaning Process ##
To prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis, the following data preprocessing steps were followed:
#### a. Duplicate Removal
Ensured that each product was uniquely represented.
#### b. Missing Value Treatment
Products with no ratings were labeled as “No rating”.

Products without reviews were counted as having zero reviews.

Discount values were cross-checked and filled where reasonable or omitted if unreliable.

#### c. Data Type Corrections
Standardized data formats for numeric fields like rating scores, review counts, and discounts.

Ratings were validated to fall within the expected range (1.0 to 5.0).
#### d. Categorical Grouping
Ratings were grouped into categories: “Excellent”, “Average”, and “Poor”.

Discounts were segmented into “High Discount”, “Medium Discount”, and “Low Discount” bands for comparative analysis.

High-rated products convert better; ensure these are visible through ads, homepage features, and email promotions.

#### Engage Customers to Review: 
Products with “No Ratings” still sell, thus by reviews build trust—consider follow-up emails or incentives.

#### Monitor New Products: 
Given their sales performance, new or unrated products should be supported with visibility and introductory offers.

## Conclusion ##
The Jumia product performance dashboard reveals a strong link between discounts, customer ratings, and sales. While high discounts drive purchases, excellent product ratings play a major role in influencing buyer trust and review activity. These insights provide valuable guidance for marketing, and customer engagement strategies on e-commerce platforms.
